# A starter for React+Nuclear projects

### Development

* before starting make sure you have NodeJS and NPM installed and configured
* npm install
* npm install -g gulp
* gulp --development --exorcist



### Build for production

* before starting make sure you have NodeJS and NPM installed and configured
* npm install
* npm install -g gulp
* gulp --production
* all files for going live can be found in static directory in `css`,
`font`, `img`, `js` and `svg` sub-directories. Normally you would use the same
structure in production and make sure static assets are served from the same
 directories to ease the build process (manual or automated)
